# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this prework study guide because I wanted to start the process of memorizing the Git flow and begin learning the basics of the languages I will be learning in my bootcamp. It was built in multiple steps, each with their own unique language/form, so I could have as many opportunities as possible to utilize the Git flow to push my work to GitHub. This application serves as a basic reminder/organizational tool of what core concepts I should be studying/fall back on when I encounter a difficult problem that may require me to revisit the basics to rebuild my program. By creating this application I have begun to commit the Git flow to memory and have received an introduction into basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This study guide can be used to ensure you are addressing the right topics while studying for the bootcamp/in the bootcamp and wanting to brush up on your fundamentals. Each section covers some key information on each topic or directs the user in the direction of said key information. The JavaScript I implemented can be observed by opening Chrome DevTools and navigating to the console tab. If you refresh the page, it will generate a random topic for you to begin studying. The code used can be used as a reference when building practice applications to further cement ones understanding.
